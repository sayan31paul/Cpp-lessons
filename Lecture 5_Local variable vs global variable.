// Local variable takes precedence over global variable.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int glo=6; //here glo is a global variable.
void sum(){
    int a;
}
int main() {
    int glo=9;  //Here glo is a local variable inside main function.
    cout << glo;

    return 0;
}

/*Note that the output of the program is 9 instead of 6. Hence local vaiable glo inside the main function is getting precedence.*/
