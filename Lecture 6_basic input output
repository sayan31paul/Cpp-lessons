/*C++ comes with libraries which helps us in performing input/output. In C++ sequence of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly known as streams

Input stream:- Direction of flow of bytes takes place from input device to main memory(RAM)
Output stream:- Direction of flow of bytes takes place from main memory to output device.*/
