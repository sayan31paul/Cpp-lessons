// Variables,charaters,scopes
/*
The different variable types present in C are as follows:-
1. int--->Stores an integer
2. float-->Stores a float
3. Char--->Able to store only one single charater like 'a','b'.It cannot store more than one letter
4. Double-->Double is same as float but it has slightly higher precision than float.
5. Boolean--->True or false.

Scope of the variable is the region of the program where the existence of that variable is valid.
Based on scope variables can be classified into two types:-
1. Local variables--> accessible only inside the function where it is declared.
2. Global variables--->accessible from anywhere inside the program.

Q.Can global and local variables have same name in C++?
Ans-->Yes. Local varaible operate only inside the function in which they are declared. They cannot interfere with global variables or local varaibles inside other function.


Data types define the type of data a variable can hold.
Data types in C++ are categorized into two types:-
  a. Built in-->int,float,char,double,bool.
  b. User-defined-->struct,union,enum
  c. Derived--->Array,pointer,function.
